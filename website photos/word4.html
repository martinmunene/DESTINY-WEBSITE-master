             <h3><b>DESTINY; WHO YOU WERE BORN TO BE</b> <br>
                YOUR DESTINY WAS CHOSEN BY GOD BUT FULLFILLED BY YOU</h3>
            <p><b>Eph 1:11</b> <br>
                All things are done according to God's plan and decision; <BR>
                    and God chose us to be his own people in union with Christ because of his own purpose, <br>
                    based on what he had decided from the very beginning. 
                  </p>



             <p> <b>YOUR DESTINY IS NOT CONNECTED WITH YOUR HISTORY   </b><br> 
                <b>1 Chron 4:9</b><br>
                And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: 
                and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow.<br><br> 
                
               <b> 1 Chron 4:10 </b><br> And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, 
                and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil,
                 that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. <br><br>

                 <b>YOUR DESTINY IS NOT WAITING YOU IN THE FUTURE IT IS TRAPED INSIDE YOU</b><br><br>
                <b>YOUR DESTINY DOOR IS ALREADY OPENED</b><br><br>

                <b>Rev 3:8</b> <br>
                 I know what you do; I know that you have a little power; you have followed my teaching and have been faithful to me.
                 I have opened a door in front of you, which no one can close.<br><br>


                 <b>WHY DO NEED ANOINTING PRESERVATION</b><br><br>
                <b>*THERE ARE MANY ADVASARIES THAT WANT TO STOP YOUR DESTINY MANIFESTATION</b><br>
                <b>1Co 16:9</b><br> 
                 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.<br><br>

                <b>*YOU CAN BE BLOCKED OR BEEN DERVETED BEFORE YOU ENTER YOUR DESTINY </b><br>

               <b> Act 9:1</b><br>  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
                 went unto the high priest,<br> 
                <b>Act 9:2</b><br> 
                And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, 
                that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, 
                he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.<br> 
                <b>Act 9:3</b><br>
                And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him
                 a light from heaven: <br>
                <b>Act 9:4</b><br>
                And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul,
                 why persecutest thou me? <br>
                <b>Act 9:5</b><br>
                And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: 
                it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks<br><br>

                <b>EXAMPLE CASE JESUS DESTINY</b><br><br>
            <b>*JESUS DESTINY WAS ANOUNCED BEFORE IT STARTED </b><br><br>
            <b>Isa 7:14</b>>br>
            Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, 
            a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<br><br>
            <b>*JESUS DESTINY WAS PLANNED FROM HEAVEN</b><br>
            <b>*JESUS DESTINED TO SAVE THE WORLD</b><br>
            <b>*THE 1ST DAY HE WAS BORN THE BATTLES BEGUN </b><br><br>
            =HE WAS BORN IN MEGER <br><br>
            <b>Luk 2:6</b><br>
              And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she
               should be delivered. <br>
            <b>Luk 2:7 </b><br> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling
             clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the in.<br><br>

             =THEY RUN AWAY FOR THEIR LIFE <br><br>
             <b>Mat 2:13</b><br>
            And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, 
            saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, 
            and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.<br><br>
            
            =THEY TRIED TO KILL HIM BEFORE TIME<br><br>
            <b>Joh 11:53 </b><br> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.<br> 
            <b>Joh 11:54</b><br>  Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto 
            a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there 
            continued with his disciples.<br><br>
            
            <b>*JESUS WAS ANOINTED TO WIN IN HIS DESTINY</b><br><br>
            <b>Act 10:38</b> <br> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power:
             who went about doing good,
            and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</p>
